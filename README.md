# A Complete Twitter Ripoff

This projects does not intend to infringe any of the laws and copyrights owned by Twitter Inc. but to learn and improve my web design skills by mimicking the Twitter interface as much as I can and thats the sole purpose that drives the development.

## Responsiveness

This project does not take the screen responsiveness into development **yet** as the responsiveness of the entire Twitter web app is outrageously intricate and is out of my league atm.

However, once the entire Twitter desktop version is ironed out, by then I will invest my time into making it as responsive as the original web app.

## Todo

- [ ] Add floating bubble for user related hovers
- [ ] Add responsiveness
- [ ] Add "more" option popover with floating layer
